Forms of cold therapy have been used for generations for a number of alleged health benefits, but which are supported by evidence? Zone 2 training is critical for improving and maintaining mitochondrial health and aerobic capacity, so we’ve put together a resource to answer all of your questions about this pillar of exercise and how to get the most out of Zone 2 training.

Introduction to My Longevity Tactics One of the foundationallessons we can take away from studying centenarians— those who have lived to the age of 100+ — is that if you want to live longer, you have to live longerwithoutchronic disease, not live longerwithchronic disease. Unfortunately, ourcurrent healthcare systemis primarily geared toward helping you live longer once you develop chronic disease. This, of course, is the opposite of the approach I take with my patients. Over 80% of deaths in people over 50 who do not smoke can be grouped into 4 main categories, what I like to call thefour horsemen of chronic disease. These are: (1)atherosclerotic disease(comprised of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease), (2)cancer, (3)neurodegenerative disease(Alzheimer’s disease being the most common), and (4)metabolic disease(a spectrum of everything from hyperinsulinemia toinsulin resistanceto fatty liver disease to type 2 diabetes). We havefive main longevity tacticsat our disposal to affect our longevity: (1)exercise, (2)sleep, (3)nutrition, (4)medications & supplements, and (5)distress tolerance. Below is a collection of podcasts and articles discussing how we can use these tactics to mitigate, prevent, and reverse chronic disease. This audio clip is from AMA #14: What lab tests can (and cannot) inform us about our overall objective of… “I still believe that a nutritional approach to weight loss without physical activity or exercise prescribed is not a good strategy.

A proteomics model may provide an alternative method for estimating risk of mortality and chronic disease Δ How a new cell-free DNA test stacks up against other available options A new observational study has reported positive associations between meat intake and type 2 diabetes risk, but let’s repeat: correlation is not causation. “I think we really need a radically different public health paradigm.” —David Allison A new study reveals that the prevalence of atherosclerosis is alarmingly high among asymptomatic adults classified as “low risk” and underscores the importance of lipid-lowering therapies for avoiding atherosclerosis progression and mortality Peter Attia is a physician focusing on the applied science of longevity.

Introduction to My Longevity Tactics One of the scariest things about heart disease is that it is often a silent killer, with few to no outward symptoms. As one of my medical school professors liked to point out, the most common “presentation” of the disease is a sudden, fatal heart attack. You know the patient has heart disease because he has just died from it. And while mortality rates from those first, surprise heart attacks have dropped significantly thanks to improvements in basic cardiac life support and time-sensitive interventions, such attacks are still fatal roughly 1/3 of the time. Below is a collection of past articles and podcasts related to heart disease prevention, atherosclerosis, coronary disease,cholesterol, apoB, and more. “Not everybody dies from atherosclerosis, but… everybody dies with it.” — Peter Attia A proteomics model may provide an alternative method for estimating risk of mortality and chronic disease A new study reveals that the prevalence of atherosclerosis is alarmingly high among asymptomatic adults classified as “low risk” and underscores the importance of lipid-lowering therapies for avoiding atherosclerosis progression and mortality “The body responds in pretty significant ways to alterations in protein availability.” —Peter Attia “I would say three-quarters of the benefits you can get towards a longer life, come solely from pursuing better health.” —Peter Attia A recent study suggests that use of medications commonly prescribed for ADHD treatment is associated with increased risk of certain cardiovascular conditions, but does it exceed the risks associated with untreated ADHD? Same study, different day: A recent study linking the sweetener xylitol to increased risk of cardiovascular events should ring a bell – but not an alarm. Δ “Metabolic health, first and foremost, is the goal of nutrition.” —Peter Attia Can reducing heavy alcohol intake significantly lower cardiovascular risk, or is the damage already done? A new study shows that the oft-ignored metric is strongly associated with heart attacks, regardless of the presence or absence of standard modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease A recent report that high protein intake contributes to atherosclerosis has limited relevance to anyone but transgenic mice Peter Attia is a physician focusing on the applied science of longevity.

peterattiamd.com_disclosures.json,"Disclosures - Peter Attia Disclosures Comment policy Companies I have invested in Companies I advise Do you participate in affiliate marketing? Are you compensated for product endorsements? Do you allow your name or image to be used by others? Do you sell ads to support your podcast? Introduction to My Longevity Tactics It is very important to me, as it has been from the moment I became a public figure, that all my potential conflicts are disclosed. I believe this is a practice that every person who is in a position of influence should adhere to, though sadly most do not. I list my disclosures in two groups, with some overlap: (i) companies I have invested in, and (ii) companies I am currently advising or have previously advised. (Note: this list does not include investments in companies that have no involvement whatsoever in my sphere of influence or line of work.) Present: Previous: This list is updated regularly. In addition to providing this list, I’d like to address a few questions you may be reasonably asking. No, I do not engage in any affiliate (i.e., kickback) marketing. Under no circumstance have I ever or will I ever receive a direct financial kickback or “affiliate” payment for any product I discuss. Most of the time when I discuss a product that I have purchased, like, and use I have no association with the company. Instead, it is a genuine unprompted endorsement as I do not accept or invite ‘free products’ in exchange for reviews. And, again, I receive no kickback, if/even when it is offered following an unannounced endorsement. No, I do not accept compensation for product endorsement. Other times, I will talk about a product or service produced by a company in one of the two categories above. I still, under no circumstance, am separately compensated to do so, nor do I have commercial or contractual obligations to do so at my insistence. This includes declining any compensation that would create an incentive to be a “paid face” of an organization or brand. Yes, but under very limited circumstances. I do not allow third-party ads using my name, image, brand and likeness I do not authorize or lend my name, image, brand, or likeness without explicit consent. My team is rigorous in pursuing legal action when we notice folks falsely using my name or my endorsement to directly promote sales via online ads. If you see anyone doing this, pleasecontact usand let us know. No, my podcast is Ad-free The only revenue generated from the podcast comes in the form of subscription via our members who receive additional benefits, beyond the free podcast, by subscribing.

For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting.
