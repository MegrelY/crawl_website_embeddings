This website,
my podcast
, and my
weekly email newsletter
all focus on translating the
science of longevity
into something accessible, digestible, and actionable for everyone.
It is extremely important to me to provide all of this
without relying on paid advertising
. To do this, our work is made entirely possible by our members, and in return, we offer exclusive content and benefits above and beyond what is available for free.
MEMBER BENEFITS
Ask Me Anything (AMA) Episodes
Immediate access to our full catalog of past AMA episodes, and exclusive access to future AMA episodes, released monthly, directly in your podcast player. These episodes are comprised of detailed responses to subscriber questions, typically focused on a single topic, and are designed to offer a great deal of clarity and detail on topics of special interest to our members.
Check out this post to see a full AMA episode
we’ve made available to you for free.
Comprehensive Podcast Show Notes
We dedicate a lot of time to providing exhaustive show notes for every episode of The Drive. Our show notes document every person, place, thing, paper, resource, and much more. Word on the street is nobody’s show notes rival ours.
Check out this post to see a free example
.
Premium Articles
These articles
are produced by Peter and our dedicated team of research analysts, and cover a wide range of longevity-related topics in much greater detail than those we send in our free weekly newsletter. Peter and our research team work hard to make these articles topical, exhaustive, interesting, and, whenever possible, actionable.
The Qualys
Podcast
The Qualys
are short (i.e., “fast”), typically less than ten minutes, and highlight the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on
The Drive
. They are released Tuesday through Friday directly in your podcast player.
Interested in Premium Membership?
Exciting news!
We’re rolling out a new website design today, bringing you a sleek, upgraded experience with your premium membership.
During this transition, we’ve temporarily paused new membership sign-ups, but don’t worry—just
enter your email below
, and we’ll notify you as soon as membership activation is available,
later today or tomorrow morning
. If you have any questions about membership or are experiencing any challenges using the website, you can reach us by email at billing [at] peterattiamd.com.

Comments are welcomed and encouraged. The purpose of comments on our site is to expand knowledge, engage in thoughtful discussion, and learn more from readers.

Criticism and skepticism can be far more useful than praise and unflinching belief.

There’s an
art and science to critical thinking
and how to conduct yourself. There’s a
multitude of fallacious appeals
we could spell out, but a good rule of thumb is not to attack the person, attack the ideas. Don’t look for the flaws in the person, look for the flaws in the hypothesis. Let’s keep the brawling to
movies depicting minor league hockey teams
and political “news” shows.

Thank you for adding to the discussion.
