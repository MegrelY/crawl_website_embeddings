Diseases & Conditions: Prevention tactics, treatments, and more
Over 80% of deaths in people over 50 who do not smoke can be grouped into 4 main categories, what I like to call the
four horsemen of chronic disease
. If you want to live longer, delaying the onset of these chronic diseases is critical.
Cardiovascular Disease
Metabolic health
Cancer
Alzheimer’s Disease & Dementia
High Blood Pressure
Insulin Resistance

Extending Lifespan (Length of Life)
One of the
foundational concepts
of longevity is that if you want to live longer, you have to live longer
without chronic disease
, not live longer
with
chronic disease. This knowledge, combined with one’s
family medical history
and
individual labs
can then help focus attention on the
specific chronic disease(s)
you are most at risk of developing.

Improving Healthspan (Quality of Life)
More often than not, people care less about how
long
they live (lifespan) and more about how
well
they live (healthspan).
Healthspan has 3 main components
: cognitive health, physical health, and emotional health.

Comments are welcomed and encouraged. The purpose of comments on our site is to expand knowledge, engage in thoughtful discussion, and learn more from readers.

Criticism and skepticism can be far more useful than praise and unflinching belief.

There’s an
art and science to critical thinking
and how to conduct yourself. There’s a
multitude of fallacious appeals
we could spell out, but a good rule of thumb is not to attack the person, attack the ideas. Don’t look for the flaws in the person, look for the flaws in the hypothesis. Let’s keep the brawling to
movies depicting minor league hockey teams
and political “news” shows.

Thank you for adding to the discussion.
