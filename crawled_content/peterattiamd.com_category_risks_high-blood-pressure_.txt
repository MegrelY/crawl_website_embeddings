High Blood Pressure
Nearly half of adults in the United States have hypertension — blood pressure with a systolic reading above 130 mmHg & a diastolic reading above 80 mmHg — and among this population, only
about 1 in 4 have their condition under control.
It is common for blood pressure to rise and fall throughout the day, but when blood pressure remains high for an extended time, it can eventually cause
a number of serious health concerns
, including kidney damage and damage to arteries of the heart and brain.
The curated content below dives into the causes and effects of high blood pressure, the connection between blood pressure and uric acid, as well as effective strategies for reducing blood pressure. My hope is that it may serve as a helpful resource to support your ongoing longevity journey.

Comments are welcomed and encouraged. The purpose of comments on our site is to expand knowledge, engage in thoughtful discussion, and learn more from readers.

Criticism and skepticism can be far more useful than praise and unflinching belief.

There’s an
art and science to critical thinking
and how to conduct yourself. There’s a
multitude of fallacious appeals
we could spell out, but a good rule of thumb is not to attack the person, attack the ideas. Don’t look for the flaws in the person, look for the flaws in the hypothesis. Let’s keep the brawling to
movies depicting minor league hockey teams
and political “news” shows.

Thank you for adding to the discussion.
