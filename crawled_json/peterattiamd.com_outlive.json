        "For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting.",
        "We have a limited number of signed copies of Outlive. Click the link below to order yours. Please note, they are only available to ship in the US.",

This incredible book is a call to action and a reminder to always participate and never be passive. It will arm you with the tools you need to live a long, meaningful, and fulfilling life.",
        "Finally, there is a modern, thorough, clear, and actionable manual for how to maximize our immediate and long-term health.

As the most accurate and comprehensive health guide published to date,Outliveis not just informative, it is important.",

Comprehensive and rigorous,Outliveis full of surprising insights into the diseases of aging that will likely kill most of us, and the tactics and techniques that can help us live longer and in better health. Attia’s writing surprises and delights us, while provoking a new way to think about longevity.",
        "Outlivea well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health.",
        "Dr. Attia’s aim is less to tell youwhat to doand more to help you learnhow to thinkabout long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. InOutlive, readers will discover:",

        "Peter Attia, MD, is the founder of Early Medical.
