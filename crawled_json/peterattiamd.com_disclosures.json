        "It is very important to me, as it has been from the moment I became a public figure, that all my potential conflicts are disclosed. I believe this is a practice that every person who is in a position of influence should adhere to, though sadly most do not.",
        "I list my disclosures in two groups, with some overlap: (i) companies I have invested in, and (ii) companies I am currently advising or have previously advised.",
        "(Note: this list does not include investments in companies that have no involvement whatsoever in my sphere of influence or line of work.)",
        "Present:",
        "Previous:",
        "This list is updated regularly.",
        "In addition to providing this list, I’d like to address a few questions you may be reasonably asking.",
        "No, I do not engage in any affiliate (i.e., kickback) marketing.",
        "Under no circumstance have I ever or will I ever receive a direct financial kickback or “affiliate” payment for any product I discuss. Most of the time when I discuss a product that I have purchased, like, and use I have no association with the company. Instead, it is a genuine unprompted endorsement as I do not accept or invite ‘free products’ in exchange for reviews. And, again, I receive no kickback, if/even when it is offered following an unannounced endorsement.",
        "No, I do not accept compensation for product endorsement.",
        "Other times, I will talk about a product or service produced by a company in one of the two categories above. I still, under no circumstance, am separately compensated to do so, nor do I have commercial or contractual obligations to do so at my insistence. This includes declining any compensation that would create an incentive to be a “paid face” of an organization or brand.",
        "Yes,  but under very limited circumstances. I do not allow third-party ads using my name, image, brand and likeness",
        "I do not authorize or lend my name, image, brand, or likeness without explicit consent. My team is rigorous in pursuing legal action when we notice folks falsely using my name or my endorsement to directly promote sales via online ads. If you see anyone doing this, pleasecontact usand let us know.",
        "No, my podcast is Ad-free",
        "The only revenue generated from the podcast comes in the form of subscription via our members who receive additional benefits, beyond the free podcast, by subscribing. More on this can be foundhere.",
        "Peter Attia is a physician focusing on the applied science of longevity.",
