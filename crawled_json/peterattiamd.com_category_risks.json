        "One of the foundationallessons we can take away from studying centenarians— those who have lived to the age of 100+ — is that if you want to live longer, you have to live longerwithoutchronic disease, not live longerwithchronic disease. Unfortunately, ourcurrent healthcare systemis primarily geared toward helping you live longer once you develop chronic disease. This, of course, is the opposite of the approach I take with my patients.",
        "Over 80% of deaths in people over 50 who do not smoke can be grouped into 4 main categories, what I like to call thefour horsemen of chronic disease. These are: (1)atherosclerotic disease(comprised of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease), (2)cancer, (3)neurodegenerative disease(Alzheimer’s disease being the most common), and (4)metabolic disease(a spectrum of everything from hyperinsulinemia toinsulin resistanceto fatty liver disease to type 2 diabetes).",
        "We havefive main longevity tacticsat our disposal to affect our longevity: (1)exercise, (2)sleep, (3)nutrition, (4)medications & supplements, and (5)distress tolerance. Below is a collection of podcasts and articles discussing how we can use these tactics to mitigate, prevent, and reverse chronic disease.",

        "“I still believe that a nutritional approach to weight loss without physical activity or exercise prescribed is not a good strategy. We should implement both and try to have people enjoying the exercise.” —Eric Ravussin",
        "“One of the promises of gene editing is that it can provide a single treatment that is a cure for the disease.” —Feng Zhang",
        "“If you’re taking these drugs, really, really pay attention to your protein consumption and your resistance training. . .that’s obviously going to be an important part of being on the right side of that body composition curve.”— Peter Attia",
        "“In humans, klotho is indeed a longevity gene. More klotho from the gene means longer life, better cognition. Take it away, shorter life, worse cognition.” —Peter Attia",
        "A new study indicates that HIIT may help delay or even reverse age-related declines in memory and learning, but this exercise modality remains just one aspect of a well-balanced regimen.",
        "A proteomics model may provide an alternative method for estimating risk of mortality and chronic disease",

        "How a new cell-free DNA test stacks up against other available options",
        "A new observational study has reported positive associations between meat intake and type 2 diabetes risk, but let’s repeat: correlation is not causation.",
        "“I think we really need a radically different public health paradigm.” —David Allison",
        "A new study reveals that the prevalence of atherosclerosis is alarmingly high among asymptomatic adults classified as “low risk” and underscores the importance of lipid-lowering therapies for avoiding atherosclerosis progression and mortality",
