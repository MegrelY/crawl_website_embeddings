        "One of the scariest things about heart disease is that it is often a silent killer, with few to no outward symptoms. As one of my medical school professors liked to point out, the most common “presentation” of the disease is a sudden, fatal heart attack. You know the patient has heart disease because he has just died from it.",
        "And while mortality rates from those first, surprise heart attacks have dropped significantly thanks to improvements in basic cardiac life support and time-sensitive interventions, such attacks are still fatal roughly 1/3 of the time.",
        "Below is a collection of past articles and podcasts related to heart disease prevention, atherosclerosis, coronary disease,cholesterol, apoB, and more.",
        "“Not everybody dies from atherosclerosis, but… everybody dies with it.” — Peter Attia",
        "A proteomics model may provide an alternative method for estimating risk of mortality and chronic disease",
        "A new study reveals that the prevalence of atherosclerosis is alarmingly high among asymptomatic adults classified as “low risk” and underscores the importance of lipid-lowering therapies for avoiding atherosclerosis progression and mortality",
        "“The body responds in pretty significant ways to alterations in protein availability.” —Peter Attia",
        "“I would say three-quarters of the benefits you can get towards a longer life, come solely from pursuing better health.” —Peter Attia",
        "A recent study suggests that use of medications commonly prescribed for ADHD treatment is associated with increased risk of certain cardiovascular conditions, but does it exceed the risks associated with untreated ADHD?",
        "Same study, different day: A recent study linking the sweetener xylitol to increased risk of cardiovascular events should ring a bell – but not an alarm.",
        "Δ",
        "“Metabolic health, first and foremost, is the goal of nutrition.” —Peter Attia",
        "Can reducing heavy alcohol intake significantly lower cardiovascular risk, or is the damage already done?",
        "A new study shows that the oft-ignored metric is strongly associated with heart attacks, regardless of the presence or absence of standard modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease",
        "A recent report that high protein intake contributes to atherosclerosis has limited relevance to anyone but transgenic mice",
